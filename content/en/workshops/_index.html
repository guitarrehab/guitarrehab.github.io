    The growing market on offer has made the process of choosing an instrument
    somewhat difficult and very susceptible to the effects of marketing and
    advertising employed by manufacturers. During the use of an instrument,
    every musician will eventually need to resort to specialized technical
    services for some kind of assistance or maintenance in their
    instrument.
</p>
<p>
    In many cases, small interventions are essential to correct or even improve
    the musicality of the instrument. Nonetheless, the instances in which
    musicians are easily convinced to pay for unsatisfactory or needless
    services are frequent. After the deed is done, many admit that they
    don&#8217;t complain since they cannot understand, and therefore argue
    about the practical result of the performed intervention.

<p>
    As repair technicians, we have concrete knowledge about the needs and
    concerns that worry musicians. For this reason, we decided to create
    educational Workshops with the goal of sharing theoretical and practical
    knowledge with the participants. Skills that allow them to be able to
    understand the functioning of their instruments, as well as to be able to
    evaluate the characteristics of their instruments in a real and effective
    way.
</p>
<p>The workshops have to two modalities:</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a title="Guitar and Bass Setup &amp; Maintenance Workshop" href="setup-maintenance-workshop">Guitar and Bass Setup &amp; Maintenance Workshop</a></strong></li>
        <li><strong><a title="Guitar and Bass Electrical Components Workshop" href="electrical-components-workshop">Guitar and Bass Electrical Components Workshop</a></strong></li>
    </ul>
</p>
