In this workshop, we aim to equip the participants with theoretical and
practical skills related to the aspects of capturing, controlling and
processing the sound produced by the string instrument. The presented
information is dedicated to electrical systems incorporated in string
instruments, both electric and acoustic. The proposed goal of the workshop is
to give the participant understanding about the electrical functioning of the
instrument and the ability to modify it according to his or her tonal and
practical preferences in an autonomous fashion. After the workshop, the
participants will be able to understand how a pickup works and comprehend the
differences between various types of pickups, as well as alter and increase the
range of configurations between several pickups. Another very interesting point
is the acquisition of the ability of identifying and understanding the
relationship between common problems and their causes, as well as defining
solutions to them.

The workshop is held in **Guitar Rehab**'s shop and will be presented in
english. A portuguese colleague will assist in case there are any language
issues.
