title: Guitar and Bass Setup & Maintenance Workshop
translationKey: setup-maitenance-workshop
---

In this workshop, we aim to equip the participants with theoretical and
practical skills in order to carry out the setup of their instrument in
an autonomous and customized fashion. The acquisition of the knowledge
and the ability to control the physical features of the instrument
enables a better technical relationship with the instrument and the
understanding that it's "good condition" is something essential for a
greater commitment to musical development.

The workshop is held in **Guitar Rehab**'s shop.
