    <strong>Guitar Rehab</strong> is a repair and restoration workshop for plucked stringed instruments, such as guitars and basses.
</p>
<p>
    The workshop was born from <strong> Adriano SÃ©rgio</strong>&#8216;s
    journeys as member and technical manager of numerous tours. During the
    tours where he travelled along side many musicians and bands, the main goal
    was to provide the best conditions for the expression of their art. It was
    on the road that his involvement with the instruments became increasingly
    deeper. That involvement culminated in the need for a place of his own
    exclusively dedicated to stringed instruments, both electric and acoustic.
</p>
<p>
    The repair department of the workshop is staffed by two technicians, with
    Adriano's main focus being on his guitar crafting project -

<p>
    Guitar Rehab has the material means and craftsmanship required to
    accomplish a wide variety of jobs, from the simplest setups to more complex
    repairs and even instrument customization and construction.
