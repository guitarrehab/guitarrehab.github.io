    <strong>Guitar Rehab</strong> is a repair and restoration workshop for stringed instruments.
</p>
<p>
    The workshop was born from<strong> Adriano SÃ©rgio</strong>&#8216;s journeys
    as member and technical manager of numerous tours. During the tours where
    he travelled along side many musicians and bands. His main goal was to
    provide the best conditions for the expression of their art. It was on the
    road that his involvement with the instruments became increasingly deeper.
    That involvement culminated in the need for a place of his own exclusively
    dedicated to stringed instruments, both electric and acoustic.

<p>
    It count 3 other people who take care of repairs and restorations, with
    Adriano having is main focus on his instrument construction project &#8211;

    The workshop has the physical means and craftsmanship needed to accomplish a
    wide variety of jobs, from the simplest tune ups to more complex repairs
    and even instrument customization and construction.
